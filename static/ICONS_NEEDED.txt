📱 PWA ICONS NEEDED

Before deploying, you need to create app icons for the PWA "Add to Home Screen" feature.

REQUIRED ICONS:
- icon-32.png (32x32)
- icon-180.png (180x180) - iOS
- icon-192.png (192x192) - Android
- icon-512.png (512x512) - Android

QUICK SOLUTION:
Use an online icon generator:

1. Go to: https://www.favicon-generator.org/
2. Upload any image (potato emoji screenshot works!)
3. Download the generated icons
4. Rename and place in this /static folder

OR MANUAL:
1. Create a 512x512 image with:
   - Deep space blue background (#0a0e1a)
   - 🥔 emoji or Bitcoin symbol
   - Neon cyan border

2. Resize to other sizes using:
   - https://www.iloveimg.com/resize-image
   - Or any image editor

TEMPORARY WORKAROUND:
The app will work without icons, but won't have a nice icon when added to home screen.
You can deploy first and add icons later!

ICON DESIGN SUGGESTIONS:
- Potato emoji (🥔) on dark background
- Bitcoin symbol (₿) with neon glow
- Cyberpunk/neon aesthetic matching v12 theme
- Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes
